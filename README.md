# ML-decision-algo
Here, I'll be using decision tree algo in order to predict whether the user's given data is apple or orange.
A decision tree is a supervised learning algorithm which takes labeled data and finds a way to separate the data into the given labels.
Let’s teach a machine the difference between images of apples and oranges. We will use an ML algorithm called Decision Tree.
Anaconda Python comes pre-built with a package called scikit-learn which has functions to make and train a decision tree.
 color and texture are called features. Color can take values “Red” or “Orange”, while texture can take values “Smooth” or “Rough”.
 The two possible labels are “Apple” and “Orange”.
 The decision tree will be taught how to use the color and texture to find out if a given fruit is an apple or an orange.
Although, I already assign the values to the variables in order to apply decision tree algo,because it works on numerical values.
After,Running the code will train the decision tree.
The code will then ask you to enter color and texture in the console window. Once you enter data, it will print the prediction for that data.
